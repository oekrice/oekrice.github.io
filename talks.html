        <h1>Talks/Posters</h1>
          <p> <strong>UKMHD 2021 Newcastle</strong><br>
         A poster based on the (at the time unpublished) outflow field work. The progress at this point was later proven somewhat obsolete.</p>
        <p> <strong> Departmental Seminar June 2021 - Behaviour of Flux Ropes in a 2.5D Magnetofrictional Model  </strong> <br>
         A summary of my work during the first year of my PhD. At this point it was the initial results from the first 2.5D parameter study  </p>
        <p> <strong>Departmental Seminar November 2021 - Global Coronal Equilibria with Solar Wind Outflow  </strong><br>
        A talk based on the outflow field paper. </p>
        <p> <strong>Glasgow University A & A Seminar January 2022 </strong><br>
         An invited talk, similar to the above. </p>
        <p> <strong>Durham and Dundee Universities MHD Research Day April 2022 - Eruptivity Criteria of 2.5D Magnetic Flux Ropes in the Solar Corona</strong><br>
         A talk summarising on our two-dimensional flux rope research, based on the paper of the same name.</p>
        <p> <strong>UKMHD 2022 Sheffield</strong><br>
         A similar talk to the above. This talk was awarded the prize for <a href ="https://ukmhd.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/">second-best student talk</a>.
        </p>
        <p> <strong>NAM 2022 Warwick - Poster</strong><br>
         A poster on our flux rope research. This was awarded a  <a href =https://www.uksolphys.org/general-news/uksp-poster-prizes-at-nam2022-winners/> UKSP poster prize</a>.</p>
        <p> <strong> Departmental Seminar August 2022 - Magnetofrictional Modelling on an Icosahedral Grid</strong> <br>
         A talk outlining the creation of the new icosahedral magnetofrictional code, which at that point was almost functional in Python. More than a year later and it is almost functional in Fortran. Progress.</p>
        <p> <strong>Durham and Dundee Universities MHD Research Day May 2023 </strong><br>
         A talk summarising the results from the new MHD study, and the comparison between the two models.</p>
        <p> <strong>UKMHD 2023 Leeds- Eruptivity Criteria of Flux Ropes in MF and MHD Models</strong><br>
         A similar talk to the above.</p>
        <p> <strong>Sheffield University Plasma Dynamics Group Seminar June 2023</strong><br>
         An invited talk, expanding on the one given at UKMHD.</p>
        <p> <strong>NAM 2023 Cardiff- Poster</strong><br>
         A poster on our flux rope research, inlcuding the new MHD simulations. This was awarded the  <a href =https://www.uksolphys.org/general-news/uksp-prize-winners-at-nam-2023//> UKSP special prize</a>.</p>
        <p> <strong>SHINE Workshop in Stowe, Vermont(!), August 2023 - Poster presentation: Eruptivity Criteria of Magnetic Flux Ropes in the Solar Corona </strong><br>
         A new poster summarising all of the 2.5D work so far, with similar conclusions to the 2023 paper.</p>
        <p> <strong> Departmental Seminar October 2023 - Modelling the Magnetic Field of the Solar Corona </strong> <br>
        An attempt to summarise all of my research to date as the PhD funding draws to a close, including work from all of the papers to date.</p>
        <p> <strong>St Andrews University Solar and Magnetospheric Theory Group Seminar October 2023 </strong><br>
         An invited talk on my PhD research as a whole,similar to the Durham seminar.</p>
        <p> <strong>Durham and Dundee Universities MHD Research Day May 2024 </strong><br>
        A talk discussing the early results on the coronal stratification work</p>
        <p> <strong>NAM 2024 Hull - Invited Talk </strong><br>
        Invited speaker for the open solar session, in which I discussed the work on predicting flux rope eruptions.</p>
        <p> <strong>EPSRC 2024 Turin - Poster</strong><br>
        Poster presenting the results of our stratification paper</p>
        <p> <strong>UK Solar Meeting 2025 Sheffield - Talk</strong><br>
        A talk on the entirety of the postdoc research, including the new 3D boundary driving methods</p>

        <h1>Teaching</h1>
        <p> I currently help with 1st-year Progamming Practicals, and have prevoiusly taught some 1st-year Calculus tutorials.
        <h1>STFC Summer School</h1>
        <p> I was on the organising committee of the 2021 Summer School, hosted in Durham. The wesbite, for historical interest, can be accessed <a href ="https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/oliver.e.rice/stfc2021"> here</a>. I was in charge of the website and various other mild organisational tasks.
