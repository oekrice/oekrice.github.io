        <p> <strong> O. Rice and A. Yeates, <a href ="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211001319R/abstract"> Global Coronal Equilibria with Solar Wind Outflow </a> </strong> </p>
        <p> Published in <i>The Astrophysical Journal</i>. A new method to model the solar corona based on radial photopsheric magnetic field measurements. The method imporoves upon existing PFSS models by taking into account the effect of the solar wind. My python code for calculating such fields is freely available <a href ="https://github.com/oekrice/outflow/"> here</a>. </p>
        <p> A figure from this paper was selected as a <a href=https://aasnova.org/2022/02/07/featured-image-magnetic-fields-and-solar-outflows/>'featured image'</a> by AAS Nova, and this work also featured in a  <a href=https://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/~tohban/wiki/index.php/A_Non-PFSS_Global_Coronal_Model/>RHESSI nugget</a>.</p>
        <p> <strong> O. Rice and A. Yeates, <a href ="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022FrASS...9.9135R/abstract"> Eruptivity Criteria for Two-Dimensional Magnetic Flux Ropes in the Solar Corona </a> </strong> </p>
        <p> Published in <i>Frontiers in Applied Mathematics</i>. The paper describes an extensive parameter study regarding the formation and behaviour of two-dimensional flux ropes. We found that there are entire classes of eruptions that cannot be preited using the so-called 'eruptivity index' and instead found that other quanitites are good predictors of eruptivity, such as the ratio of axial rope current to total relative helicity. Some of these quantities predicted eruptions with up to 93% accuracy.</p>
        <p> <strong> P.Bhowmik, A. Yeates and O. Rice, <a href =https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022SoPh..297...41B/abstract> Exploring the Origin of Stealth Coronal Mass Ejections with Magnetofrictional Simulations </a> </strong> </p>
        <p> Published in <i>Solar Physics</i>. A paper describing the behaviour of 'Stealth CMEs', coronal eruptions that do not have any clear signature on the solar surface. I assisted with the two-dimensional paramter study.</p>
        <p> <strong> O. Rice, <a href ="https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/64/2/2.22/7077787"> Magnetic Predictions </a> </strong> </p>
        <p> Published in <i>Astronomy and Astrophysics Magazine</i>. An article summarising my PhD research so far, discussing both the work on outflow field equilibria and the 2.5D magnetofrictional parameter study. I was asked to write this article after winning the UKSP Poster prize at the National Astronomy Meeting 2022.</p>
        <p> <strong> O. Rice and A. Yeates, <a href ="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...955..114R/abstract"> Eruptivity Criteria for Solar Coronal Flux Ropes in Magnetohydrodynamic and Magnetofrictional Models</a> </strong> </p>
        <p> Published in <i>The Astrophysical Journal</i>. A follow-up paper to the first eruptivity criteria paper. We expand upon that work by now including a new magnetofrictional model in polar coordinates, and an MHD study using the LARE2D code. We also introduce more possibilities for potential eruptivity criteria, with a proposed new definition for the eruptivity index. We also compared the criteria for flux rope instabilities in both MF and MHD, deducing that the magnetofrictional method can indeed be used (with care) in place of MHD in certain scenarios.</p>

        <p> <strong> O. Rice, <a href ="https://etheses.dur.ac.uk/15645/">Eruptions and Equilibria in the Solar Corona</a> </strong> </p>
        <p> My PhD Thesis. Contains all the work of the above papers, plus a desription of the development of a new global magnetogrictional code based upon an icosahedral grid, which has not yet been published elsewhere.</p>

        <p> <strong> O. Rice and C. Prior, <a href ="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1ae/meta">Investigating the Effects of Atmospheric Stratification on Coronal Active Region Field Modeling</a> </strong> </p>
        <p> Published in <i>The Astrophysical Journal</i>. A paper discussing the initial results found during my postdoc with Chris, namely a 2.5D parameter study using MHD and magnetofrictional moels to investigate the effects of including the chromosphere in coronal magnetic field models.</p>
