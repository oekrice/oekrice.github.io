        <!-- insert the page content here -->
        <p align="justify">This page is intended to mention the things I do and like apart from the main solar physics research that I actually get paid for. It should not be taken too seriously.</p>
        <p align="justify"> <strong>Bells</strong><br>
        I am quite a keen church bellringer, ringing regularly at the churches around Durham. I have taught several people to ring (mainly other students) and regularly travel the country to explore interesting places and socialise. The maths behind ringing is really quite interesting and is worth looking into if you like that kind of thing. </p>

        <p align="justify"> <strong>Music</strong><br>
        I play the clarinet and the piano, and in my 7 years at Durham have become very involved with Student Music. I have helped organise dozens of concerts, a couple of music tours abroad and was invited to the Steinway piano factory to help pick out some of the University's brand new very expensive pianos. I play the clarinet in Durham Unvierstiy Concert Band, and have played in the Palatinate Orchestra in the past when I had more free time. I was vice-president of the DU Keyboard Instrument Society, treasurer and vice-president of Music Durham and have almost 2 million views on YouTube of me breaking a concert grand piano. </p>

        <p align="justify"> <strong>General Interests</strong><br>
        In no particular order, and without explanation (in addition to the above): Architecture (especially ecclesiastical/gothic revival), Beer, Railways, Magnetic Confinement Fusion, Cycling (not very quickly), Driving (quite quickly), Cats, The English Countryside and exploration thereof. </p>
